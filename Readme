This is a To Do app I built using Angular.js. It was a follow along with a video to learn Angular.js. I feel that the project
was a success in explaining Angular.js to me and learning how to debug my mistakes that I had made. I relyed on Google to assist me 
in a few things but over all good. I do need to edit some errors yet so the project is not complete but in review.
